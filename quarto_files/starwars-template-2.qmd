title: "Exploring Starwars characters"

We want to work with the `starwars` dataset, which is part of the `dplyr` package. Since we also need `ggplot2`, we load the `tidyverse`.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages-ex-starwars
library(tidyverse)
```

### Tasks


__Task 1__


```{r}
#| label: add-label-1
#| eval: false
ggplot(starwars, aes(x = height)) + 
  ___

ggplot(starwars, aes(x = mass)) + 
  ___

ggplot(starwars, aes(x = birth_year)) + 
  ___

```



__Task 2__


```{r}
#| label: add-label-2
# add code here
# pay attention to correctness and code style

```



__Task 3__


```{r} 
#| label: add-label-3
# add code here
# pay attention to correctness and code style

```
