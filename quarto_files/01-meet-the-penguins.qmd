title: "Meet the penguins"
---

_Note: Exercise is based on work from Mine &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel._ 

For this application exercise, we'll use the **tidyverse** and **palmerpenguins** packages.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

**Demo:** Add the chunk option ` message: false` to the above chunk. See what happens.


The dataset we will visualize is called `penguins`.
Let's `glimpse()` at it.

**Your turn:** Replace `#add code here` with the code for "glimpse"ing at the data `penguins` data frame â€“ `glimpse(penguins)`. Render the document and view the output.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-penguins

# add code here
```

**Demo:** First, replace the blank below with the number of rows in the `penguins` data frame based on the output of the chunk below. Then, replace it with "inline code" and render again.

```{r}
#| label: nrow-penguins
#|  
nrow(penguins)
```

There are \_\_\_ penguins in the `penguins` data frame.

You can use inline R code if you don't want to enter the value by hand:

There are \_\_\_ penguins in the `penguins` data frame.


#### Insert code chunk

**Your turn:** Assign the value 2 to an object called `x` and multiply by 3.



**Demo:** In the console, add 5 to the object `x`. What happens?
